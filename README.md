# Baseball-Pitching
The final report for a course in Categorical Data Analysis.

This project involved the analysis of pitching data from the 2018-2019 MLB season to determine whether "high-heat" fast balls (fast balls in the upper fringe of the strike zone) are more likely to be called strikes than pitches in the other fringes of the strike zone. I used logistic regression and random forest models to perform my analysis.
